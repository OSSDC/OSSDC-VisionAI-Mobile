# OSSDC VisionAI Mobile - Android

**Companion Android application for https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionAI-Core project**

This project has support for https://Race.OSSDC.org WebRTC based platform, to allow for extensive and quick testing of computer vision and neural nets algorithms.

It also enables easy manual or automated remote control of robots, while supporting two way audio/video/data communication.

It can be used to build telepresence robots.

## Demo videos with OSSDC VisionAI Core based processing on remote machine

See more examples on how to use it in https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionAI-Core project.

The app can control (over USB) OpenBot, Neato an SPARK Assistant based robots. Demo code and videos will be provided soon.
