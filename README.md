### OSSDC VisionAI Mobile - Android

This project has support for Race.OSSDC.org WebRTC based platform, to allow for extensive and quick testing of computer vision and neural nets algorithms.
It enables easy manual or automated remote control of robots, while supporting two way audio/video/data communication.

Demo videos with OSSDC VisionAI Core based processing on remote machine:

	- Mono depth over WebRTC using Race.OSSDC.org platform

See more examples on how to use it in https://github.com/OSSDC/OSSDC-VisionAI-Core project.

The app can control (over USB) OpenBot, Neato an SPARK Assistant based robots. Demo code and videos will be provided soon.
